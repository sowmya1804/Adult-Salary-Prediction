# Project Title: Adult-Salary-Prediction

## Description  
Dataset link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult  
In this project,I have chosen number of different supervised algorithms to precisely predict individuals income using Adult data Set collected from the UCI machine learning repository. Then I have chosen the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data.Goal with this implementation is to build a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000.  
Target Variable : salary (<=50K, >50K)  
## Steps Involved
1.Import Libraries and Load Data
2.Performing EDA on Train Data
3.Encoding Categorical Data
4.Loading Test data
5.Feature Scaling
6.Model Evaluation
    *Logistic Regression
    *Decision Tree Classifier
    *Random Forest Classifier
    *Hyperparameter tuning with Random Forest Classifier  
## Observations  
The optimized modelâ€™s accuracy and F-score on testing data on random forest classifier are 77% and 64.5% respectively.
